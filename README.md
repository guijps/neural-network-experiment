# neural-network-experiment

This is a code to implement something close to Pytorch in C++.

I will use https://medium.com/@thakeenathees/neural-network-from-scratch-c-e2dc8977646b as reference and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTkIWUupQpk.

First step is to use Pytorch to create a NN that recognizes numbers and clothe pieces.
this way I will familiarize myself with the procedure to create and train a NN. 

Second part of the project is to implement the diferent parts using C++.
